        </p>
    <h3>Can soccer players drink alcohol?</h3>
    <p>Yes, soccer players can drink alcohol but with caution and they can’t bring alcoholic drinks with them to the soccer pitch. Soccer players must understand the effects of alcohol and how it influences their career before indulging in it.</p> 
        <p>Alcohol is manufactured by fermenting sugar, starch, and yeast using a simple fermentation process. Ethanol is the alcohol found in alcoholic drinks and beverages and it is its major intoxicating constituent.</p>
        <p>In a real sense, alcoholic drinks do give energy to the body but at the same time, it poses a negative effect on your body’s circulatory, endocrine, and nervous systems because of the ethanol content present in them.</p>
        <p>Alcohol when taken in high dosage, depresses the central nervous system and affects all the organs in the body. It also causes drowsiness and at some point, respiratory depression, it can also act as a stimulant when taken in lower doses.</p>
        <p>When alcohol is constantly taken over a long period, it causes a lot of damage to the body especially when taken in high dosage; some of these damages of alcohol that soccer players must be aware of are listed and described below:
        </p>
    <!-- <h4>Damage to the Liver</h4>
    <p>The organ in the human body responsible for the breakdown and removal of toxic materials from the body is the liver. When you ingest a high quantity of alcohol over a long period, it tempers with the liver’s breakdown process thereby putting you at risk.</p>
        <p>These results in liver disease or liver inflammation caused by cirrhosis which leads to liver damage and its inability to remove dangerous materials from your body.

        <p>The organ in the human body responsible for the breakdown and removal of toxic materials from the body is the liver. When you ingest a high quantity of alcohol over a long period, it tempers with the liver’s breakdown process thereby putting you at risk.</p>
        <p>These results in liver disease or liver inflammation caused by cirrhosis which leads to liver damage and its inability to remove dangerous materials from your body.</p>
        <p><b>Sexual dysfunction</b></p>
        <p>Erectile dysfunction is sometimes experienced by men who consume too much alcohol, unlike the wild belief that it aids you in having a great time in bed, alcohol lowers your libido and averts sex hormones from producing.</p>
        <p>Too much consumption of alcohol can cause infertility in women, miscarriage, stillbirth, or premature birth. When pregnant women drink a lot of alcohol, it puts unborn babies at risk.</p>
        <p><b>Heart disease</b></p>
        <p>The heart is very delicate and shouldn’t be tampered with, which is why taking a high quantity of alcohol over a long period poses threat to the heart. Impairment can come in the form of heart attack, heart failure, and heart disease.</p>
        <p><b>Muscle cramps and thinning bones</b></p>
        <p>The popular practice of constantly ingesting alcohol, causes your bones to become thinner, thus putting you at risk of easily sustaining fractures during a collision and these fractures will take longer periods to heal.</p>
        <p>Atrophy, muscle cramps, and muscle weakness can be triggered by a high dosage of alcohol intake.</p>
        <p><b>Affects the immune system</b></p>
        <p>The immune system is responsible for fighting viruses and germs that are harmful to our health. High consumption of alcohol limits the immune system from properly carrying out its task thereby exposing a victim to attacks from germs and viruses.</p>
        <p><b>Brain disorder</b></p>
        <p>When you drink alcohol too much, the communication between your brain and your body is limited which leads to difficulty in coordination. Your speech will be slurred, you won’t be balanced and numbness may set in, also making sensible decisions and clear thinking will be very difficult.</p> 
        <p>No law exempts soccer players above 18 years old from drinking alcohol but it is recommended that they know when to drink it and in very moderate amounts.</p>
        <p>With all the above-mentioned damages, soccer players are strongly advised to closely monitor their alcohol intake levels if they must drink and also drink responsibly as stated on most alcoholic drink commercials.</p>
        <p>The Sporting Event (Control of Alcohol etc.) Act 1985 drafted out some offenses that relate to soccer matches and alcohol. This act prohibits alcohol from being conveyed to the stadium and from the stadium, and any player or spectator caught in possession of alcohol while in transit to and from the match is culpable of punishment.</p>
        <p>The act also prohibits players from entering the field with alcohol, and any player or match official who is drunk during a soccer match must be punished accordingly.
        </p>
    <h4>Is alcohol bad for soccer players?</h4>
    <p>There are many kinds of soccer namely, futsal soccer, indoor soccer, beach soccer, and association football, all these sports need the participating players to be at their best and right state of mind to be able to perform optimally.</p>
        <p>Some people believe that alcohol gives you poise and helps you think straight, but that belief is outlandish because alcohol does more harm than good especially to soccer players who are constantly trying to improve on their performance.</p>
        <p>Alcohol is not good for soccer players especially when they drink it before and after soccer matches or during training. This is because alcohol limits a player’s performance by making him/her absent-minded, aggressive, or drowsy.</p>
        <p>Alcohol causes dehydration in the body which can be a huge risk for soccer players as it can trigger muscle strain and muscle pull. As a professional soccer player, we believe you wouldn’t want such things to happen to you on the soccer pitch.</p>
        <p>Drinking alcohol after a match can slow down the replacement of the muscle’s glycogen, and disrupt rehydration. Alcohol is not entirely bad else it won’t be manufactured at all. We are only trying to help you understand that it can adversely affect your soccer career.</p>
        <p>Some recommendations have been given on guidelines for the safe consumption of alcohol. Note that all alcoholic drinks comprise different ethanol percentages and so the higher the ethanol percentage in an alcoholic drink, the stronger its effect will be on you.</p>
        <p>Alcohol consumption is measured in units, each unit is 10ml of 8gms of ethanol. In the UK, adults are recommended to drink a maximum of 14 units of alcohol a week and it shouldn’t be taken at a stretch. It should be divided into days and different occasions with free days off in-between.</p>
        <p>In the US, the recommended level of alcohol intake per week is 12-14 grams of ethanol which is higher than that of the UK, therefore males are advised to drink 1-2 grams a day while females are advised to drink 1 gram per day.</p>
        <p>If a soccer player wishes to drink alcohol, he/she must endeavor to follow these guidelines as it helps to put them in check.</p>
        <p>The best drinks for a soccer player before and after a match are:
        </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Water (very essential)</li>
        <li>Protein shakes</li>
        <li>Fruit smoothie</li>
        <li>Sports drink like Gatorade</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Soccer players above 18 years of age are not entirely prohibited from drinking alcohol although it is wrong to drink alcohol while playing or training. Drinking heavily a night before a soccer match is also wrong and must not be an option.</p>
        <p>Every soccer player must always try to understand that taking more glasses of alcohol than required can adversely affect their overall performance and ruin their team’s chances of winning a match.</p>
        <p>All soccer players should remain disciplined towards alcohol intake no matter the pressure they might be facing in their private lives.
