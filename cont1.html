    <h2>Can Soccer Referees Change Their Decisions?</h2>
    <p>Soccer has been in existence for many decades. It is a team sport that has a maximum of 11 players (10 field players and 1 goalkeeper) from each team—and three to five substitutes.<p> 
        The goalkeeper’s role is to stop the opposite team from scoring. He is the only player allowed to use his arms and hand to catch, throw, and save the ball, but only within the pitch perimeter.</p> 
        <p>Back in the old days, soccer rules were not clear and players often went away without a booking after starting a scuffle with the opponent. That is no longer the case today.</p> 
        <p>Several other rules apply to all players or are specific to goalkeepers. One of the newest has to do with goalkeeper movement during a penalty kick. In the past, the goalkeeper was allowed to move around before a penalty kick.</p>       <p>Now, their movement is limited and their legs must be on the line when the ball is kicked for the save to count. They can even earn a yellow card for moving their legs from the goal line when the ball is kicked.</p> 
        <p>Referees appear to be the judge and jury of a soccer game and some of them are famous for flashing cards and making controversial decisions. The big question now is, can a referee change his or her decision?</p>
        <p>Is it possible for a referee to give a player a red card and after a few seconds of rethink rescind the decision for a yellow? We have all the answers that you have been searching for in this article.</p>

    <h3>Can soccer referees change their decisions?</h3>
    <p>Referees are saddled with the responsibility of ensuring that soccer games not only remain safe but also fair for both teams by enforcing the rules of the sport. They spend the entirety of the match either on the field of play or running the sidelines monitoring out-of-bounds and offside calls.</p>
        <p>There are 17 laws of the game that officials work collectively to maintain all through a soccer game. Apart from the head referee, there are two linesmen (assistant referees), a fourth official, and a video match official all working together to make sure that match rules are upheld.</p>
        <p>Decisions are made to the best of the official’s capability according to the laws of the game and based on the judgment of the center referee who has overall power to take final decisions during the game.</p>
        <p>According to <b>Tom Stagliano</b>, a high school college and USSF soccer referee, in the sport of soccer (association football), the referee may change her/his decision before the next restart. Once the referee restarts the match, no past decision may be reviewed or changed in that game.</p>
        <p>Another instance where referees are not allowed to change decisions they made is after they terminate a half. For example, if a referee made a bad decision immediately before ending a first or second half, they can’t reverse that decision no matter how much pressure is directed at them.
    </p>
    <h3>How often do referees change their decisions?</h3>
    <p>It wasn’t always common to see soccer referees changing their initial decisions until the introduction of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) in 2018. VAR was earlier tested in 2016 but was officially introduced to the game in 2018.</p>
        <p>Whenever a referee isn’t sure of the decision they made, they seek assistance from the VAR to confirm before changing or upholding that decision. There is no fixed time interval in which a referee is allowed to change a decision.</p>   
        <p>Because of the introduction of the VAR technology, more and more referee decisions are being overturned these days in soccer and the number of critical bad decisions made by soccer referees has reduced.</p>
        <p>Before the year 2018, many soccer fans bitterly complained that referees deliberately made extremely controversial decisions during major soccer matches to favor their preferred teams. This often led to situations where angry fans invade pitches after the final whistle is blown to physically abuse soccer referees.</p>
        <p>Physically attacking soccer referees is not tolerated in soccer, soccer fans guilty of such nefarious acts can get banned from stadiums for life and fined huge sums of money for damages.
        <p>Referees’ performances in top soccer leagues are evaluated after each match and low-performing referees are either sacked or demoted at the end of the season. Although it rarely occurs in soccer; soccer referees can be sacked immediately after a game.</p>
        <p>Graham Poll, a former English soccer referee was fired after officiating a match between West Bromwich Albion and Derby County in 2007. Graham made a terrible decision during that World Cup match which led to the end of his admirable career.</p>
        <p>For you to understand clearly how the decision-making process of referees has been transformed presently, let’s take a deeper look at the VAR technology.
        </p>
    <h4>VAR (Video Assistant Referee)</h4>
    <p>A Video Assistant Referee also called VAR is a soccer match official who reviews the verdict made by the center referee using video footage and a headset for communication. The VAR technology was introduced in soccer to correct missed incidents and fix obvious errors.</p>
        <p>The VAR team is stationed somewhere called the Video Operation Room (VOR) and their job is to keep a constant check on the on-field referee’s decisions. Silent checks by the VAR team don’t cause any delay during matches because the referee is communicated using an earpiece.</p>
        <p>During major incidents, the referee halts a game few minutes or seconds for the VAR team to properly check whether a mistake occurred. The VAR team can either call for a decision overturn or an on-field review (OFR) although the referee can ignore the VARs advice if they feel like it.</p>
        <p>The introduction of VAR technology has helped in revising unfair decisions. During a quarterfinal match in the UEFA Champions League between Manchester City and Spurs, Manchester City scored what should have been the winning goal under the 90th-minute mark but it was canceled due to an offside.</p>
        <p>Some pros and cons of the VAR system are stated below:
        </p>
    <h4>Pros of VAR</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>This system aids a referee to make an informed decision in regards to an incident during the match which brings about better decision making</li>
        <li>Some games are often remembered because of certain VAR decisions taken by the referee that changed the faith of the game</li>
        <li>It helps in maintaining player's discipline which is an integral part of sports</li>
        <li>A referee can miss crucial moments or incidents that can define the outcome of matches, but the VAR technology helps in pointing them out instantaneously</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cons of VAR</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>There is time wastage because VAR technology involves a careful analysis of an incident</li>
        <li>There is a lack of transparency</li>
        <li>When an incident is under review, the VAR team and central referee engage in private discussions before revealing somewhat suspicious conclusions</li>
        <li>VAR works with electronics and can become faulty at crucial moments</li>
        <li>Decisions can be subjective, thereby creating an avenue for controversy, which isn’t healthy for the game</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Can a referee overturn his decision after the match has restarted in soccer?</h3>
    <p>A restart decision may not be reversible by the center referee when he/she realizes that an error was previously made which should have been rectified before calling for a restart. The same rule applies if a referee has signaled the end of the first or second half (including extra time) and left the field of play.</p>
        <p>However, referees are allowed by law to restart matches according to IFAB (International Football Association Board). There is a recorded incident between Brighton and Man United where a late penalty was awarded to Man United after the final whistle was blown.</p>
        <p>The move was questioned by several soccer fans who wondered if play can be restarted even after the final whistle. However, even though such kinds of incidents rarely occur, referees must try as much as possible to avoid them because most soccer fans and players don’t believe such rules exist.</p>
        </p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The referee may only change an incorrect decision on the advice of an assistant referee or the fourth official, provided that he has not restarted play or terminated the match. However, with the introduction of VAR, the controversy around the major decisions that referees take during soccer matches is not as rigid as it used to be.</p>
        <p>If referees constantly change their decisions due to pressure from players and soccer fans alike, they will see it as an avenue to always force referees to reverse their judgment whenever they feel like it.
